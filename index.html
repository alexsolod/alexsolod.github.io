DataDecides Lead Posting Instructions
Welcome to DataDecides's Lead Posting Instructions. These instructions will enable you to begin posting leads over into our system. Before beginning, it is important that you have received a Source ID from your account rep. If you haven't received one already, please contact your account rep and request a Source ID. This is the unique ID for your company so we can keep track of what leads you transmit over to our system. If you need any help, please contact tech@datadecides.com. 

1) DESTINATION URL: The URL you will send leads to is: http://api.datadecides.com (the same URL you are viewing now). 

2) DATA TRANSMISSION METHOD: We accept both HTTP POST and HTTP GET methods when sending data. 

3) SUCCESS OR FAILURE: We provide a response of SUCCESS or FAILURE, and in cases of FAILURE we also provide the reason of FAILURE, after every lead submission. If there are multiple reasons of failure, you'll be notified of the first one that we identify. These failure responses will be especially helpful in troubleshooting your initial set up. 

4) LEAD FIELDS: The following fields are the fields that we collect and store. Make specific note of the fields that are required since without that data, leads will not be received and will result in an instance of FAILURE. We do not collect or store any fields that are not in this table. Make sure you use the exact field names when passing data and be sure to urlencode your fields as well. 

Example: http://api.datadecides.com/?source_id=&website=testdomain.com&first_name=test&last_name=test&email=test@test.com&ip=12.34.56.78&captured=2015-06-01%2000:00:00
