<h1>BFF's Lead Posting Instructions</h1>
<h3>Welcome to BFF's Lead Posting Instructions.  </h3>
<br>
1) DESTINATION URL: The URL you will send leads to is: http://api.datadecides.com (the same URL you are viewing now). 
<br>
2) DATA TRANSMISSION METHOD: We accept both HTTP POST and HTTP GET methods when sending data. 
<br>
3) SUCCESS OR FAILURE: We provide a response of SUCCESS or FAILURE, and in cases of FAILURE we also provide the reason of FAILURE, after every lead submission. If there are multiple reasons of failure, you'll be notified of the first one that we identify. These failure responses will be especially helpful in troubleshooting your initial set up. 
<br>
4) LEAD FIELDS: The following fields are the fields that we collect and store. Make specific note of the fields that are required since without that data, leads will not be received and will result in an instance of FAILURE. We do not collect or store any fields that are not in this table. Make sure you use the exact field names when passing data and be sure to urlencode your fields as well.

Example: http://api.datadecides.com/?source_id=&website=testdomain.com&first_name=test&last_name=test&email=test@test.com&ip=12.34.56.78&captured=2015-06-01%2000:00:00
